# CTRL API Wrapper

This is the wrapper I created to interface with CTRL's database. Given that CTRL was evaluated as not fit for purporse, this is defunct.

However, it is the only thing I've written where I've been satisfied with the quality so I'm leaving it.

Setup is irrelevant, but if for some reason CTRL does make a return, email me at `alex@rivi.io` and I'll be more than happy to explain.
